# [IT3280E] Assembly Language & Computer Architecture Lab
This repository contains source codes (mostly in assembly) for the lab class. Lab classes are conducted weekly, and the folders are also numbered accordingly.

> Note: All the codes are in their final form. For each lab, there are Home Assignments (hx) and Lab Assignment (ex). Some lab assignments are the continuous completion of their respective home assignment, and their names are `hx` instead of `ex`.
